This is my attempt at explaining design science research,
a methodology for doing research that is particularly
useful if you're developing a product. <!--more-->

At the time of this writing, I am enrolled
as a Software Engineering student, trying to find a
methodology for my final project. What I'm trying to do is quite
different than most of what my friends are doing, which are
web-based information systems or AI applications.

Most of the papers I read for this project don't even
mention their methodology. They just go straight to their methods.

Our supervisor handles a lot of students, so they split us into groups.
When my group met our supervisor, my friend was advised to look
into Design Science Research for their methodology. I have never
heard of this methodology, so I was intrigued. This post is a
summary of what I found so far.

Design science research (sometimes abbreviated as DSR) is a methodology
that aims to create and evaluate *artifacts*. An artifact can be anything
that a human is able to come up to solve a particular problem.
In the context of my project, the artifact is a
language server. Artifacts aren't limited to just software, or anything concrete. It can
be a cognitive framework, a mathematical model, really _anything_ that can solve
the research problem.

Tools like [MyResearchProcess](https://myresearchprocess.com) can help document
the research process.

If you're wondering, my friend didn't end up making this their
methodology. Guess who did though.
